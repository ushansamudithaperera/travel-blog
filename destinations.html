    <h3>1. Sri Pada</h3>
    <p> Sri Pada is one of the most sacred Buddhist pilgrimage sites in Sri Lanka. The mountain is deeply revered because of the sacred footprint (Sri Pada) at its summit, believed by Buddhists to be the footprint of the Buddha. For centuries, devotees have climbed this holy peak to pay homage and to experience the spiritual atmosphere that surrounds the site. The pilgrimage season, which begins in December and continues until May, is marked by thousands of faithful Buddhists ascending the mountain to offer prayers and seek blessings. </p> <p> The climb is traditionally undertaken during the night, guided by illuminated pathways and small rest stops where pilgrims gather strength for the journey ahead. Reaching the summit at dawn is a powerful and moving experience, as devotees worship at the shrine while witnessing the first rays of sunlight breaking over the central highlands. The view of the mountain’s shadow stretching across the valleys is considered both a natural wonder and a spiritual symbol. Sri Pada is not only a challenging climb but also a profound religious journey, representing devotion, endurance, and the timeless heritage of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. </p>

    <h3>2. Sigiriya</h3>
    <p> Sigiriya, often called the “Eighth Wonder of the World,” is an ancient rock fortress located in Sri Lanka’s cultural triangle. Rising 200 meters above the plains, this iconic site was once a royal citadel built by King Kashyapa in the 5th century. Its massive rock column is surrounded by elaborate gardens, reservoirs, and moats, demonstrating sophisticated urban planning that was centuries ahead of its time. Today, it is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of Sri Lanka’s most visited attractions, blending natural splendor with archaeological brilliance. </p> <p> Visitors climbing Sigiriya encounter a fascinating journey through history and artistry. The lower levels feature landscaped water gardens and boulder gardens, while midway up the climb, you’ll discover the famous frescoes of celestial maidens that still retain their vibrant colors after more than a thousand years. Further up, the Mirror Wall—once polished so highly that the king could see his reflection—contains ancient graffiti written by early visitors. At the summit, the remains of the royal palace and panoramic views of the central plains provide an unforgettable reward for the climb. Beyond being a fortress, Sigiriya is a masterpiece that tells stories of ambition, power, and creativity. </p>
